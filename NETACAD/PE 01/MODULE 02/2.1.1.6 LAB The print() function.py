"""use the print() function to print the line Hello, Python! to the screen. Use double quotes around the string;
having done that, use the print() function again, but this time print your first name;
remove the double quotes and run your code. Watch Python's reaction. What kind of error is thrown?
then, remove the parentheses, put back the double quotes, and run your code again. What kind of error is thrown this time?

# Sample Solution
